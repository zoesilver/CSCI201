Here are projects that I have completed so far as a part of USC's CSCI201: Principles of Software Development class.

Project 1: Parse JSON objects and provide functionality for organizing stocks. 

Project 2: Builds on Project 1 but uses multi-threading and semaphores to allow for multiple operations to be executed at the same time.
